# ATM

# 1. Introduction
- We assume:
  - Every single user can only have one saving account,one checking account,one loan account and one stock account.
  - We have different interest rates for day saving, month saving, year saving.
  - Every 60s in real life equals one hour in our bank system, where interest rates will be calculated at daliy basis.
  - Our exchange rate is steady, which USDTOEURO=2 , USDTOCNY = 10, EUROTOUSD = 0.5, EUROTOCNY = 5, CNYTOUSD = 0.1, CNYTOEURO = 0.2
  - We have three type of interest rate(day, month, year), they are all steady. User can choose what kind of account they want while creating account
  - We set up a simple stock system, where manager can add stocks to the market, and customers can buy or sell them.
- Bonus: Input is getting parsed from the input files and is not harcoded: Details in **config.properties**; we provide exchange rate for three currencies we have (USD, CNY, EURO), and how many second equails to one day.(defualt: 60s second = one day in our bank system)
- Bonus: We build our stock market; in order to buy stock, you have to create a stock account first in "create account" page. THen you can sell/buy in "Stock" Page.

# 3. Get Start


First you need to compile the program
```
cd ./src
javac Main.java
```
If error ***UnicodeEncodeError: 'gbk' codec can't encode character: illegal multibyte sequence*** appears, I will suggest to compile use the following command
```
javac -encoding UTF-8 Main.java
```
Then run
```
java Main
```
Then enter the username and password we provide at the beginning of the file. (You can choose customers or managers to play with)
